"""The launcher process, should send commands portal and game.

Internally, the launcher process is a very short-lived process most of
the times: it connects to the CRUX server (hosted on the portal process)
and run one command (usually just one) before shutting down.  The launcher
process is the one behind the `talismud` command, handling specific
actions.  Hence, when running `talismud start`, or `talismud stop`,
the launcher process is executed.
