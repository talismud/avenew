"""Base class of all contexts.

A context is a "step" in the session process.  A context displays some
information and handles user input.  A simple context, the
message-of-the-day, is created whenever a session is createed.  This
context will greet the new session and display instructions to login.
From there, depending on user input, the session will move
to a different context (say, the creation of the username, for instance,
or the password).

In short, a context represents the "step" of a connected session.
It handles user input (text entered by the user connected to this session).
When "logged in" to the game, a character can be connected to
one or more contexts.  By default, a logged-in user is connected to
a single context: the one that interprets commands.

class Context:

    """Class defining a context.

    Class attributes:
        text: a text that doesn't require further processing.  In case
              you want the text to change depending on session information,
              override the `greet` method instead.  Don't hesitate
              to use multiline strings, they will be dedent-ed
              (see `textwrap.dedent`).
        prompt: the prompt as a string.  A prompt is sent
                below the text of the context, or any call to
                `msg`.  The method `get_prompt`, if overridden,
                can handle additional operation and return
                a different prompt based on
                the session's information.

    Instance attributes:
        session (Session): the session object.  You can use
                          `session.options` to access the session's
                          option handler which can be handy to store
                          information on the session itself.
                          This information will be available as long
                          as the session exists (that is, even if the
                          game stops and starts again, as long as the
                           session is maintained by the user).

    Methods:
        greet()            greet the user with some text.  The text
                           to be displayed should be returned (return
                           `None` to not send any text at all).
        enter()            The session first enters this context.  By
                           default, this method just calls `greet` and
                           sends its returned text to the session.  This
                           method is not called if the session already
                           is on this context without moving to another.
                           That's why you should always have a `text`
                           class variable or `greet` method that does return
                           some text, overriding `enter` isn't that
                           frequent, except to perform memory
                           operations on the session for instance.
        leave()            Called when the session is about to leave
                           this context to go to another.  By default,
                           this method does nothing.
        move(new_context)  Move the session to a new context.  The
                           current context's `leave` method will be called,
                           then the new context will be created with
                           the same session and its `greet` method will
                           be called.  You shouldn't override this method,
                           just use it.
        msg(text)          Send some text to the session.  This is just
                           a shortcut for `self.session.msg(text)`.
        refresh()          Called when the user asks for a refresh.  By
                           default, calls `greet` and send the result to
                           the session.  This method will also be called
                           by `enter` if not overridden.

    Contexts have a simple in-built command system.  Contexts can
    define methods that will be called when a user enters text that
    matches the method name.  For instance, if you want to react
    when the user enters "help", define a method called
    `input_help` in your context.  This method will be called
    ONLY if the user enters "help" or possibly "help something".
    In the second case, the argument ("something") will be passed
    to the `input_help` method.  So your `input_help` can be
    defined in two ways:

        def input_help(self):

    OR

        def input_help(self, args: str):

    Arguments will be passed to the method only if it asks for them
    (has a positional argument after `self`).  If the context can't
    find an `input_...` method matching user input, it will then
    call `other_input` and send the entire user input as argument.

    Don't override `handle_input`, just create `input_...` and
    `other_input` methods on the context.
