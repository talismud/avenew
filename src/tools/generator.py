"""Module containing the RandomGenerator class.

A random generator is used to create unique, semi-random numbers
following specific constraints.  To use it, create a subclass of
`tools.generator.RandomGenerator` with rules.

Here is an example of a phone number generator that should generate
7 numbers with a dash between the third and fourth.  A phone number
cannot contain three times the same digit in a row:

```
import string
from tool.generator import RandomGenerator

class PhoneNumberGenerator(RandomGenerator):

    patterns = (
        string.digits,
        string.digits,
        string.digits,
        "-",
        string.digits,
        string.digits,
        string.digits,
        string.digits,
    )

    @classmethod
    def is_allowed(cls, code: str) -> bool:
        '''Return whether this code is allowed (only check the end).'''
        allowed = True
        if len(code) >= 3:
            last = code[-1]
            allowed = not code.endswith(last * 3)

        return allowed
```

It is then simple to use:

```
from ... import PhoneNumberGenerator

unique = PhoneNumberGenerator.generate()
# > 551-3722
unique = PhoneNumberGenerator.generate()
# > 200-7715
```

Note: a phone number like "111-XXXX" will never be generated, because
it would break the rules.

The `patterns` class attribute should contain a collection of valid
characters for every letter in the code to be generated.  Here,
we have set it to 3 digits, followed by a dash, followed by four digits.
To explain the rules, we set the `next_allowed` method.  It receives
the code being generated (a string of characters of length lower than
the list of patterns) and the set of possibilities.  The set of possibilities
should be altered and returned and a random character from this set
will be chosen.  Hence:

1.  When we call `PhoneNumberGenerator.generate()`, the first character
    is chosen randomly from the first patterns.  Let's say it's "5".
2.  Next, we find the available patterns for the next character:
    all digits are valid.  So we try several codes: what we have
    generated so far ("5") plus all the available options
    ("51", "52", "53"...).  We call `RandomPhoneGenerator.is_allowed()`
    on all of them and only keep the options that
    return `True`.  We randomly select a valid option (say "55").
3.  We repeat the same process: allowed patterns are all digits
    for the next character.  But when we try to see if
    `PhoneNumberGenerator.is_allowed("555")`, we get `False`, indicating
    this is not a valid option.  So we remove "5" from the list of valid
    choices for the next character.  We then select a random number
    from 0 to 4 or 6 to 9.  Let's say "9", so our code for the time
    being is "559".
4.  ... and so on until we have 10 digits.  Notice that
    we didn't take into consideration the dash which
    should be ignored when our rule is selected, but it's easy to add.

Finally, notice that codes shouldn't repeat: once a code is generated,
it cannot be generated again.  Behind the scenes, the generated code
is stored in the database, along with specific portions
of the code.  This is done automatically.
