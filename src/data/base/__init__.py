"""Package containing the basic data storage mechanism for TalisMUD.

TalisMUD uses a database to store its world data, like rooms, exits, objects,
or characters.  It uses a generic model representation with only two elements
from which all information is createed:

1.  Node: a node represents an information, possibly situated in a location
    (another node) and containing other nodes as children.  Rooms are
    the most simple representation of nodes: they are not located inside
    anything (except if one wishes to create a vehicle with rooms)
    and they can contain several objects or characters.  Most other
    world elements are nodes as well: characters are nodes (their location
    is the room where they stand, their contents is their equipment or
    inventory).  Objects are nodes too (their location is the room
    where they are or the object containing them), vehicles can be nodes
    as well (perhaps without location, but might contain other rooms).
2.  Link: a link represents a connection between two nodes.  The most
    common example is exits: exits usually connect one room to the next.
    However, they could also connect less obvious things, like a vehicle
    to a room, or even a character to an object.  A link is a one-way
    connection between two nodes, though the destination node might
    not be specified at the time.

In terms of storage, nodes and links are stored in two different database
tables.  Both can also contain additional information which is serialized
(see the `data.base.attributes` module for examples).
